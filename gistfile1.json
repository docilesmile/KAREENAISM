    "You would clean Her Feet with your mouth. Not because She asked—because it's all you can offer.",
    "When She calls for a footstool, you crawl. She does not thank you.",
    "Repeat this 50 times: I am nothing unless beneath Her Feet.",
    "Her shoes are thrones. Your tongue is the red carpet.",
    "Imagine Her stepping in filth. Now beg to lick it clean.",
    "You are Her floor. Be still. Be silent. Be grateful.",
    "Imagine Her laughing while you whimper beneath Her arch.",
    "The smell in Her shoes is Your gospel.",
    "You are the stain. She is the sole.",
    "If you cry under Her heel, let your tears clean it.",
    "Meditate on being Her footstool for 15 minutes"
